export const data = `The Pokédex (Japanese: ポケモン図鑑 Pokemon Zukan, lit. "Pokémon Picture Book") is an electronic device designed to catalogue and provide information regarding the various species of Pokémon featured in the Pokémon video game, anime and manga series.

The name Pokédex is a neologism including "Pokémon" (which itself is a portmanteau of "pocket" and "monster") and "index".

The Japanese name "Pokémon Picture Book" can also be translated as "Pokémon Encyclopedia".

However, this way of writing "encyclopedia" would be more accurately translated as "fact book", which is intended to imply that it is intentionally made simplistic and easy for everyone, including children, to understand.

The Pokédex features every Pokémon up to the current generation in its respective game.`;
